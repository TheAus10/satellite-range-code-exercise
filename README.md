# satellite-range-code-exercise

This project is a coding challenge for a job interview. The project calcualtes the distance between a radar and a satellite in orbit. The radar's location is given in coordinates adhering to the WGS84 standard and the satellite's location is given in coordindates given in the ECEF standard. This project converts WGS84 coordinates into ECEF and then calculates the distance between the satellite and the radar in meters.
